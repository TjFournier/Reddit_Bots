# HW # 04 Reddit Bots

For my bot, half the comments are about Biden not doing something productive/actual news. And the other half are essentially boxing announcements involving Biden.

My favorite subreddit is [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/main_discussion_thread/) Mainly because my account has the top comment on the thread.

```
len(comments)= 103
len(top_level_comments)= 52
len(replies)= 51
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 0
len(not_self_replies)= 49
len(valid_replies)= 49
========================================
valid_comments= 49

```

I bileve that my score should be 20, becuase I completed the 6 tasks for the bot.py file and did the GitHub Repo.
